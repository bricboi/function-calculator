### Display bar

The app also has a display bar where it will display numbers inputed by the user and will also show the full calculation of the input. Once the user has clicks on a button on the numberpad, the number appears in the display bar. After that the user can click on a function they want it to compute and the calculation will be displayed. Once the user clicks on the numberpad again, only the number inputted will be shown to the user.

### Keypads

Underneath the display bar there are two keypads. One for inputing numbers, a decimal point, deleteing and clearing the display, and one for the functions. The User will input a number (only one decimal point is counted), and will then click on a function button to execute the calculation. Which will then be displayed on the display bar.

### Possible features
* More functions can be added in the future that could create more complex calculations.
* Minus button so that the user can calculate functions with negative numbers.

## Testing
